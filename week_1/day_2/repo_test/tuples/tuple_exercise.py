# 1. Create a tuple called 'my_task' for a task containing the following data:
# 'Make Dinner'
# 'Tomorrow'
# 2
# False

# 2. Print the tuple

# 3. Accessing the tuple by index,
# print the object in the tuple with the value 2

# 4. Using the appropriate method, print the number of objects in the tuple

# 5. Get the index of the object in the tuple with
# the value 'False' and print it out

my_task = ("Make Dinner", "Tomorrow", 2, False) #1
print(my_task) #2
print(my_task[2]) #3
print(len(my_task)) #4 len is a function
print(my_task.index(False)) #5 index is a methode (built into the tuple)
